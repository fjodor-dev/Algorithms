# Algorithms
practicing with Algorithms

I learnd the theorie of how the Algorithm works and practice it on some playing cards, then translated it to code.

I only used my own code, Until the sorting method was completed i did not see or copy any code, I only watchd the explanation of how the Algorithm worked!

Until now I hef written selection-sort, bubble-sort and quick-sort
